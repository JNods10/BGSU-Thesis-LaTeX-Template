\chapter{\texorpdfstring{APPENDIX A\hspace{1em}SELECTED R PROGRAMS}{APPENDIX A}}

An appendix is a pretty good place to put short programs or lists of data items or other things that a reader wants to be able to see, but might not ever actually look at.
Sometimes a document will have more than one appendix.
That's OK.
You can label them A, B, C, however many you need.

% If you want to put program codes in the appendix, here is one example. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The function kernel is used to compute the kernel function of variances
{\small \tt
\begin{verbatim}
kernel=function(x,y){
  h = 0.5*(x-y)^2
  return(h)
}
\end{verbatim}
}
\end{itemize}


\pagebreak  % if you have another appendix, put a \pagebreak here so the bookmark for the next page will point to the right place
