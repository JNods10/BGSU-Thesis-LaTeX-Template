An abstract is required.
That is maybe 300 words that conveys the setting and the main point of the work.
It might be helpful to only use the most necessary special characters in the abstract, because it's a bit difficult to get them into OhioLink; see the Readme for ways to get ChatGPT to help with converting LaTeX to HTML.

Darth Vader:
	There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you.

	You have only begun to discover your power. Join me,
	and I will complete your training. With our combined
	strength, we can end this destructive conflict and
	bring order to the galaxy.
Luke Skywalker:
	I'll never join you!
Darth Vader:
	If you only knew the *power* of the dark side. Obi-wan
	never told you what happened to your father.
Luke Skywalker:
	He told me enough! He told me *you* killed him.

	No. *I* am your father.
